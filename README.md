# Boilerplate
Contains code snippets for different tasks, components, and usages, which can be quickly combined and tweaked into a production quality application.

## Project structure
This project consists of many small projects that serve as a use case template divided by general themes.

## Contribution
Since Visual Studio solutions don't support physical folders, a workaround is used: the main solution contains a physical folder, that contains a theme solution. A logical folder with the same name is created in main solution, to where the theme solution is added.
